First repository
Super nervous and excited to jump on GitHub!
Pretty nervous about jumping on GitHub, but I was told this is the place to go to interact with great programmers  and to find projects.  I want to get better at programming and/or coding, so I;d like to utilize this site to its fullest.  Trying is the first step at learning anything, at least that is what I think!
